The contents of these folders are scripts that can be included into your project directly (as opposed to the spacepuppy dll's) to add exensibility features to it.

- SPAGAstarBridge - a couple of classes to allow 'Aron Granberg A* Project' and 'SPPathfinding' to get along nicely together.

- SPCamera - classes that add base functionality to SPCamera. Includes code borrowed from Unity themselves (the Standard Assets project), and so is not included out right as part of Spacepuppy.

- InputSettings - input settings used for SPInput to function properly
